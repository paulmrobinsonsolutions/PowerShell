#*********************************************
# Purpose: This script will "watch" the OCR processing folder for files that get "stuck" trying to OCR. These "bad"
#          files can be observed when the file count ticks up and down repeatedly very quickly. This indicates the
#          OCR tool is attempting to process the file but fails which is typically due to the size of the file or
#          simply a poor quality file that cannot be OCR'd by the OCR tool. Files that cannot get processed, will
#          be moved to the backlog folder so that processing may continue for all of the other files in the folder.
#          Once all files are processed in "watch folder", any files in the "Backlog" folder will be moved back to the
#          "watch folder" one-by-one to attempt OCR-ing again. If they fail again, they're moved to "exceptions" folder.
#
# General script processing:
#   1. Check $sourceFolder for any files...
#      1A. If files exist, then "check" each file up to $checkCountThreshold specified with 5 seconds between each check.
#          If the file still exists after $checkCountThreshold has been reached then move the file to the $backlogFolder
#          folder location specified. This is a temporary location where each file will be tried one more time.
#      1B. If files do NOT exist, then look in the $backlogFolder and move one file at a time back into the $sourceFolder
#          for the checks outlined in 1A. If the file cannot be moved then the file is moved to the $exceptionFolder
#          specified where the Business will then manually work these.
